              </a>
              <p class="font-medium text-base text-secondary mb-6 truncate">
                IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) was founded in 1911 under
                the name Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) which was formed from
                the merger of several companies engaged in the fields of calculating,
                recording and data processing. In 1924, the company changed its name to
                IBM and focused on developing computer technology. IBM was the world's
                largest information technology company in the 1970s and 1980s, creating
                innovative products such as mainframes, personal computers, and operating
                systems. In the 1990s, IBM went into decline and underwent major
                restructuring to strengthen its position. Currently, IBM focuses on
                information technology services and provides business solutions, cloud
                computing, and cyber security.

              </a>
              <p class="font-medium text-base text-secondary mb-6 truncate">
                The Intel Corporation was founded in 1968 by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore,
                who at the time were leading engineers at the semiconductor company
                Fairchild Semiconductor. Intel focused on the development and production
                of microprocessors, which were originally used for personal computers.
                In 1981, Intel released the 8086 microprocessor used in the IBM PC computer,
                which became the industry standard at the time. In the following decades,
                Intel continued to develop microprocessor technology and launch innovative
                products such as Pentium and Core. Apart from that, Intel also invests
                in other technologies such as flash memory and artificial intelligence.
                Today, Intel remains a major player in the semiconductor industry, and
                continues to innovate to meet increasingly complex technology needs.

                Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who were doctoral
                students at Stanford University. They created an innovative and effective
                search engine, using a PageRank algorithm that takes into account the
                interrelationships between web pages. Google quickly grew into a successful
                company and continues to grow by launching various products and services
                such as Google Maps, Google AdWords, Google Chrome, and Android. In 2004,
                Google made an initial public offering (IPO) and became a public company.
                Currently, Google is part of Alphabet Inc. and remains one of the world's
                largest technology companies, with a focus on developing search technology,
                online advertising, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing services.

                Microsoft Corporation was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Initially,
                Microsoft produced software for personal computers, and in 1981, launched the MS-DOS operating
                system which became standard at the time. In 1985, Microsoft launched the
                Windows operating system which became one of the largest and most successful
                products in the history of computer technology. Microsoft also produces
                productivity software such as Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer. In
                the 2000s, Microsoft entered the game console market with the launch of
                the Xbox and focused on cloud computing services with Azure. Today,
                Microsoft remains one of the world's largest technology companies and
                develops products and services such as Windows 10, Surface, and Microsoft
                Teams.

              <p class="font-medium text-base text-secondary mb-6 truncate">
                The history of computers begins in the 19th century, when Charles Babbage developed
                an automatic calculating machine called the Analytical Engine. However, the
                achine was never finished. At the beginning of the 20th century, the IBM company
                produced the first vacuum tube computer in 1951 which was used for military purposes
                In the 1960s, the first transistor computers were launched and replaced the vacuum
                tubes, which made computers smaller and more efficient. In the 1970s, the microprocessor
                was invented and allowed the development of smaller and less expensive personal
                computers. Then in the 1980s and 1990s, personal computers grew in popularity and
                became affordable for the general public. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries,
                technological developments accelerated with the emergence of the internet and mobile
                technology, resulting in computer devices such as laptops, tablets and smartphones
                that were very popular and became an essential part of modern life.

              <p class="font-medium text-base text-secondary mb-6 truncate">
                The dark side of the internet is that part of the internet that is not accessible
                through search engines like Google and can only be accessed using certain software,
                such as Tor. On the dark side of the internet, many illegal activities such as drug
                trafficking, weapons and personal information are stolen and sold. In addition,
                the dark side of the internet is also a gathering place for extremist and terrorist
                groups who use the internet as a tool to spread their ideology. This has led to
                worldwide concern about how to deal with the threats that arise from the dark side
                of the internet and how to deal with the crimes that are committed within it.
                Nonetheless, the dark side of the internet also has positive uses, such as
                enabling users to maintain their privacy and security in using the internet
                and becoming an important tool for journalists and human rights activists to
                expose crimes and human rights violations that occur around the world.

                developing an operating system for mobile devices. In 2005, Google bought Android Inc., the company Rubin and friends 
                formed to develop Android, and acquired the Android development team. In 2007, Android was officially released and became 
                the main competitor of Apple's iOS. Android is currently the most popular mobile operating system in the world and is used 
                in various types of mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and smartwatches.

                 which then became the main focus of their business. Since then, AMD has continued to compete with Intel in the microprocessor and graphics 
                 card markets, and they have produced a number of successful products in the market.AMD or Advanced Micro Devices is an information technology 
                 company from the United States that focuses on the production and development of microprocessors, graphics cards and other processing technologies.
